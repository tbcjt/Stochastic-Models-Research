# Quantitative research project

This repository contains a research project focused on modeling financial securities and eveloping quantitative trading strategies.

## Goals
- Explore stochastic models for asset prices (GBM, GARCH, jump-diffusion, etc.).
- Implement strategies based on statistical and ML methods.
- Backtest strategies
- Evaluate performance using Sharpe ratio, drawdown, and robustness checks.

## Project structure

- `data/raw/`: Raw historical data
- `data/processed/`: Cleaned and structured datasets
- `scripts/`: Helper scripts for data, models, and backtesting
- `paper/`: Draft of research paper
- `results/`: Backtest results, figures, logs
